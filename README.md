# Maze Solver

A **Maze Solver** that reads the maze from text file 
and solves it using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm.    
The process of solving the maze and the current state of the 
maze are visualised step by step on the command line.


## Requirements
- Any Text Editor (VSCode , Atom , DEV-C++, XCode)   
- GCC Compiler
## How to Run
Run the commands below on the Path where the File is saved.

 on Linux: 
```bash
gcc Maze_Solver.c -o Maze_Solver.exe
./Maze_Solver
```
on Windows:

```bash
gcc Maze_Solver.c -o Maze_Solver.exe
Maze_Solver.exe
```
on Mac:

```bash
